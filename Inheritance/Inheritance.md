What is Inheritance
-------------------
	Inheritance is a technique of sharing the properties of base class within the child classes.

	It is one of the core stone of java OOPs concept.

	Using inheritance one can create a class, which is known as base class, that holds the common traits to a set of 	related items.

	It helps in code reusability .

	Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

	There are some terminologies used in Inheritanec :

	 	base class :
        	The class that is inherited is known as base class or super class or parent class.
	 	child class :
        	The  class that inherits the property of one class is known as child class or extened class 	 or sub class.
         reusability :
         	This can be achieved bwhen we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class.

	  The  inheritance is performed by  the help of ==extends== keyword in java.
  	It connects the child class to the base class.
    ```
    class Base 
    {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    }
    class Sub extends Base
    {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    }
    ```
    	In the above example Base is the super class that inheritated by the child class Sub.
